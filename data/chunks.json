Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis, with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, have been \nreported with Atorvastatin and with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.

When the dosage of Atorvastatin \nwas reduced, or when drug treatment was interrupted or discontinued, serum transaminase levels \nreturned to pretreatment levels. The increases were generally not associated with jaundice or other \nclinical signs or symptoms. Most patients continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin \ncalcium without clinical sequelae. If increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to greater than 3 \ntimes the upper limit of normal and are persistent, the dosage should be reduced or the drug \ndiscontinued. Liver function tests should be performed before the initiation of treatment, and repeated as clinically \nindicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in \npatients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms \nand/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with Atorvastatin, promptly \ninterrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart Atorvastatin. Atorvastatin, as well as other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, should be used with caution in \npatients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of \nAtorvastatin; if such a condition should develop during therapy, the drug should be discontinued.",

Atherosclerotic lesion development was assessed in the thoracic aorta and chronically denuded iliac-\nfemoral artery of hypercholesterolemic New Zealand White rabbits fed a 0.5% cholesterol, 3% peanut \noil, 3% coconut oil diet either alone or containing 2.5 mg/kg atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, or \nsimvastatin for 8 weeks. The lipid content of the iliac-femoral artery was unaffected by treatment; \nhowever, atorvastatin significantly reduced the thoracic aortic cholesterol ester content by 55% and free \ncholesterol content 45%. Atorvastatin significantly decreased the cross-sectional area of the iliac-\nfemoral lesion by 69% and monocyte-macrophage content by 71%. In the descending thoracic aorta, a \nsite of spontaneous, diet-induced atherosclerotic lesions, atorvastatin significantly reduced the \npercentage of grossly discernible atherosclerotic lesions.",

On the other hand, the animal with experimental \ndiabetes, is sensitive to a much lower dosage, providing some insulin is still secreted. The antihyperglycemic action of metformin is probably mediated through insulin: \nMetformin improves the K co-efficient of glucose assimulation. Metformin improves the co-efficient of insulin efficiency. In the obese diabetic with hyperinsulinemia, metformin is reported to normalize insulin output. This normalizing effect is concurrent to that of glycemia. Metformin has little effect on liver glycogen of the healthy animal. In low and average doses, no \nchange occurs. In high doses nearing lethal levels, liver glycogen decreases. This lowering \nprecedes the fall in blood sugar. This reaction represents a defense mechanism tending to \nmobilize body reserves in order to combat hypoglycemia. In the diabetic animal with a low liver glycogen reserve, the opposite occurs and metformin \nbuilds up glycogen stores of the liver. In vitro, on muscular tissue isolated in Warburg's \napparatus, metformin increases glucose uptake by the muscle. This action follows an aerobic \npathway. Even in high concentration, contrary to phenethyl-biguanide, metformin apparently \ndoes not block respiration or change carbohydrate metabolism via the anaerobic pathway.
